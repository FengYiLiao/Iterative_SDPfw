# Iterative_SDPfw

This work is an extension of our paper: [Block Factor-width-two Matrices and Their Applications to Semidefinite and Sum-of-squares Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11076)

We aim to develop iterative method to approxiamte PSD cone constraint. 
Our algorithm generate a sequence of lower/upper bound of the solution.
