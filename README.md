# Iterative_SDPfw

This work is an extension of our paper: [Block Factor-width-two Matrices and Their Applications to Semidefinite and Sum-of-squares Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11076)

* Block factor-width two matrices (including diagonally dominant and scaled-diagonally dominant matrices); see our paper: 


Large PSD cone constraint might be hard to handle in general. 
We aim develop iterative method to Inner and Outer Approximate the PSD cone using the notion Block Factor-Width-2 matrices. 

Iterative method of factor width 2
